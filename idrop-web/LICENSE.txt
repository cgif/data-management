iRODS Copyright and Licensing

iRODS is open source software released under a BSD License, see license text in "iRODS License Terms and Conditions" below. 
The BSD license has been described in very general terms as allowing you to do whatever you want to with the software and 
source code as long as you acknowledge who wrote it and that, as with any open source software, there is no warranty and you're using the code "as is."
In the spirit of collaborative open source software, the iRODS community encourages you to communicate with us, letting us know what features you like, 
features that would be useful, problems, bugs, suggestions, etc., and to perhaps contribute source code.
The iRODS community has formed the Data Intensive Cyberinfrastructure Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation established to serve
 as the home of the iRODS open source community over the long term. If you choose to contribute new code, you'll receive full acknowledgment. All you do is complete the Contributor's Agreement, under which you retain copyright ownership
  in your code but give a free license to the iRODS nonprofit foundation, allowing your code to be integrated into iRODS and in turn released under the BSD license.
Note: The above text is an educational overview of iRODS open source licensing, and not intended as legal advice nor is it part of the iRODS license agreement, which is below. As always, for legal advice consult an attorney.
